# Xcode_CardsProject_Code
A simple card app made with Swift and UIKit. Cards change randomly until the 'Stop' button is pressed. Once stopped, the button changes to 'Reset' to restart the cards. Includes a 'Rules' button. The project focuses on creating interfaces purely with code, without using Storyboards.
